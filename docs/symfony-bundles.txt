List of some interesting bundles.

1. DoctrineFixturesBundle

Fixtures are used to load a controlled set of data into a database. This data can be used for testing or could be the
initial data required for the application to run smoothly. Symfony has no built in way to manage fixtures but Doctrine2
has a library to help you write fixtures for the Doctrine ORM or ODM.

# How to install
php composer.phar require --dev doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle

# Several commands
php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load
php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load --append


2. AliceBundle

Alice - Expressive fixtures generator

Relying on fzaninotto/Faker, Alice allows you to create a ton of fixtures/fake data for use while developing or testing
your project. It gives you a few essential tools to make it very easy to generate complex data with constraints in a
readable and easy to edit way, so that everyone on your team can tweak the fixtures if needed.

# How to install
php composer.phar require --dev hautelook/alice-bundle
php composer.phar require --dev nelmio/alice

# Several commands
# --append - Use this flag to append data instead of deleting data before loading it (deleting first is the default behavior);
