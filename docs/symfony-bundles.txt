List of some interesting bundles.

1. DoctrineFixturesBundle

Fixtures are used to load a controlled set of data into a database. This data can be used for testing or could be the
initial data required for the application to run smoothly. Symfony has no built in way to manage fixtures but Doctrine2
has a library to help you write fixtures for the Doctrine ORM or ODM.

# How to install
php composer.phar require --dev doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle

# Several commands
php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load
php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load --append
