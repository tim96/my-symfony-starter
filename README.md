# Symfony starter kit
Starter kit project for symfony 4

I am using Symfony 4.4 because it has LTS support at this moment.  
The next LTS release probably will be Symfony 5.4.  

Contains:
- Doctrine packages for connect with databases  
- Fixture packages for generate mock data for test cases  
- RabbitMQ and ElasticSearch libraries
